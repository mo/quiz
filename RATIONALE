_do actions and _do scripts

QuizMaster has been designed to run on a PHP configuration where register
globals is off; because such configurations are inherently more secure.

script/page_ contain the content of the main pages.
script/do_ contain scripts that execute action as a result of form submits.
script/inc_* contain content which is included in several pages.

all other scripts are collections of utility function related to a specific area,
for instance database.php contains general MySQL functions and user.php contain
stuff relating to quiz site users etc.

Q: why use ugly URLs?
A: because mod_rewrite is not always installed and we want to minimize the list of dependencies

All pages must have a proper DOCTYPE defined, otherwise MSIE users will experience a faulty
CSS box model (this is due to a bug in MSIE). So always include this (or similar for loose):

  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
     "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
