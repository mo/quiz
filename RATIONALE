QuizMaster has been designed to run on a PHP configuration where register
globals is off; because such configurations are inherently more secure.

script/page_ contain the content of the main pages.
script/do_ contain scripts that execute action as a result of form submits.
script/inc_* contain content which is included in several pages.

All other scripts are collections of utility function related to a specific area,
for instance database.php contains general MySQL functions and user.php contain
stuff relating to quiz site users etc.
